By now, Sherbiny Holdings shines the Gulf Area and the Middle East with its several joint ventures and diversified services. The name and business strength that has been earned by Sherbiny Holdings, is due to our 120 professionally equipped and dedicated individuals who identify and exploit the right opportunities. With numerous regional locations, multiple services and manufacturing facilities, Sherbiny is poised to effectively support anyone’s project needs. In the recent years my two sons have also taken an important role in the everyday operation of our company. I believe that the commitment that followed the life of our company will live on with the future generations as well.<b>"</b></p>
